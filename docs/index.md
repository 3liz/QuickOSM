QuickOSM is a QGIS plugin to download data from Overpass server.

QuickOSM allows you to work quickly with OSM data in QGIS thanks to
[Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API).

!!! info "March 2021, internship in France / Stage en France 🇫🇷"
    Sorry, this is available only in France. Nous proposons un
    [stage pour l'amélioration de QuickOSM](https://docs.3liz.org/internships/quickosm/).

* [Write some queries for you by providing a key/value](./user-guide/end-user.md)
* Choose to run the query on an area or an extent
* Configure the query : which layers, which columns…
* Open a local OSM (.osm or .pbf) with a specific osmconf in QGIS
* Build some models with [QGIS Processing](user-guide/processing.md)

There are some useful tips, like automatic colours on lines (if the tag is present),
or some actions (right-click in the attribute table) for each entity (edit in JOSM for instance).
